mostly a to-do up to hosting myself

i'll have to do a LOT of IoT/networking, but I think I can handle that.
hard thing will be to limit it to a few hours a day and make exuses for not being social.
timing sucks.

I have to do... what... why... when... this will be edited out and since it's github, it will be here FOREVER HAHA
so what to say- n3u2o was here et cetera :)
